# McDowell CV — Modified Versions (`mcdowellcv_2`, `_3`, `_4`)

This is a modified and modernized fork of the original **McDowell CV** LuaLaTeX class, originally created by [Daniil Belyakov](https://github.com/dnl-blkv), based on the resume design proposed by Gayle L. McDowell at [CareerCup](http://www.careercup.com/resume).

These modified templates are designed specifically for **modern academic and technical resumes**, especially for:
- Undergraduate/graduate students
- Internships and research applications
- ATS-friendly and hyperlinked resumes
